    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This homemade cinnamon ice cream is a delicious frozen treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir half-and-half and sugar together in a saucepan over medium-low 
            heat until mixture begins to simmer. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the hot mixture into the eggs, whisking quickly to avoid 
            scrambling the eggs. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and whisk 
            in heavy cream. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, 
            until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Remove from the heat, 
            and whisk in cinnamon and vanilla. Set aside to cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's 
            instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze 
            until firm or desired consistency, about 2 to 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
